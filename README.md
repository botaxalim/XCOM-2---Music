This mod ADDS the music of XCOM 2 to Rimworld (it don't replace any vanilla
music!) The files are dynamically aranged: e.g. Music most will be played in
battle and few music will be heared at night. The battle music will only play when there a threat, raid, or enemies around the map.

INSTALLATION:
make my mod as local folder mod
If you got the music from the offical soundtrack CD or, lets say, YouTube (you know what I mean ;)

the link for following track XCOM 2
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mQnXtWcWBeYZfuH962cLLQb4Oo32u18PQ
convert the files to .ogg files format, you can use whatever converter you want.
rename the following music tracks as the picture
It's very important that the music will have the same names as the picture e.g. "Lazarus" , "Ready For Battle" ,otherwise the .xml won't recognize the files!

put the files in \Steam\SteamApps\common\RimWorld\Mods\XCOM - Music\Sounds
Enjoy

As it is a very simple mod XCOM - Music is compatible with other music mods
this mod safe to add and remove mid save game, can go anywhere in the load order.

I do NOT own any of the audio used in this mod, nor the mods have any audio files. all credit goes to Tim Wynn
