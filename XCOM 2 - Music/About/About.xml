  <description>Adds 29 XCOM 2 music
  Author notes: The file don't include any original music files of XCOM 2 or any other copyright protected stuff! The .xml only manage the files that the users will place to their Rimworld mods folder!
  
  This mod ADDS the music of XCOM 2 to Rimworld (it don't replace any vanilla music!) The files are dynamically aranged: e.g. Music most will be played in
battle and few music will be heared at night. The battle music will only play when there a threat, raid, or enemies around the map.

As it is a very simple mod XCOM - Music is compatible with other music mods
this mod safe to add and remove mid save game, can go anywhere in the load order.

I do NOT own any of the audio used in this mod, nor the mods have any audio files. all credit goes to Tim Wynn
XCOM 2 is a 2016 turn-based tactics video game developed by Firaxis Games and published by 2K Games
